# Journal Prompts Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin for Obsidian is designed to enhance your journaling experience by providing random prompts to inspire creativity and enrich your journal entries.

## Features

-   Generate random journal prompts
-   Insert prompts into your current note with a single click
-   Prompts are inserted in Obsidian's callout format for easy identification and styling

## How to Use

1. Install and enable the plugin in Obsidian.
2. A default prompts library called "Journal Prompts Lirary" will be created. You can modify it by yourself. Every line of text in that file will be treated as a prompt.
3. Open the Journal Prompts modal using the command palette or the ribbon icon.
4. Click the "Refresh" button to generate a new random prompt.
5. Click the "Insert" button to add the displayed prompt to your note:
    - If a note is currently open, the prompt will be inserted at the cursor position.
    - If no note is open, the plugin will automatically create a new journal entry and insert the prompt.

## Installation

I havn't submit this plugin to the Obsidian community yet. You can mannually install this plugin.
